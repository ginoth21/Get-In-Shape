~Angles are the space between 2 lines that make up a vertex, and they are measured in degrees.
~ Acute angles are angles less than 90째, right angles are 90째, and obtuse angles are angles greater than 90째.
~The formula to find the sum of the angles of any shape is S = (n-2) X 180, where S is the sum of a shape's
angles and n is the number of sides it has.
~Regular shapes are shapes with all angles equal (i.e. a regular hexagon has 6 angles that are all 120째).
