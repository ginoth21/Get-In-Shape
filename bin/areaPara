~The formula to find the area of a parallelogram is A = B X H.
~This is because parallelograms are similar to rectangles, the only difference being their angles.
~The formula to find the area of a trapezoid is A = (a + b) X  H/2.
~The areas of the parallelogram and trapezoid above are highlighted in magenta.
