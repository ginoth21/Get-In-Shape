~The perimeter of a shape is the length of the outside of the shape. It is outlined in the above shapes in magenta.
~To measure the perimeter of any shape (except circles), you just add up the lengths of all the sides.
~In the case of the rectangle above, perimeter = 2L + 2W.
~In circles, circumference = π X diameter = 2πr (since diameter is twice the length of the radius).
Note: π is the ratio of a circle's circumference (its perimeter) to its diameter. It is approximately equal to 3.14159.
